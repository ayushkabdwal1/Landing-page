The landing page code consists of HTML and CSS files that work together to create an engaging and visually appealing landing page.
The HTML file provides the structure and content of the page, while the CSS file adds styling and visual enhancements.
In the HTML file, you'll find a basic structure that includes a header section for the page header, a section with an id of "hero" for the hero section, and additional section elements for different sections of the landing page, such as features, testimonials, and a call-to-action. Within each section, appropriate HTML elements are used to structure the content.
For example, headings (h1, h2) are used to provide titles and subtitles, p tags for paragraphs of text, and ul and li tags for lists. The CSS file is linked to the HTML file using the link tag within the head section. 
It contains styles that are applied to the HTML elements to enhance the visual presentation of the landing page.
This includes defining colors, fonts, margins, paddings, backgrounds, and other properties to achieve the desired look and feel. 
By combining the HTML and CSS files, the landing page is created, giving a cohesive and visually appealing design.
It provides a clear structure, readable text, and visually appealing elements to engage visitors and guide them through the content on the page. .
